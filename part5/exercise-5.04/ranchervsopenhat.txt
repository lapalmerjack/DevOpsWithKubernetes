I would choose Rancher because:

Free and Open Source Core:
Rancher is entirely open source and free to use, while OpenShift has a fully open-source base (OKD) but its full-featured version is often tied to Red Hat subscriptions.

Multi-Cluster, Multi-Cloud Management:
Rancher shines at managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across different environments (cloud, on-prem, edge) with a unified dashboard. OpenShift is more focused on its own managed clusters.

Vendor Agnostic:
Rancher supports any certified Kubernetes distribution (EKS, AKS, GKE, RKE, K3s, etc.). OpenShift is tightly coupled with Red Hat’s Kubernetes distribution.

Lightweight Options (e.g., K3s):
Rancher supports K3s — a minimal, lightweight Kubernetes distribution ideal for edge and resource-constrained environments. OpenShift is relatively heavyweight.

Simpler Installation & Maintenance:
Rancher is generally easier and faster to install and operate, especially for smaller teams or simpler use cases. OpenShift setup and lifecycle management can be complex.

More Flexible CI/CD Integration:
Rancher doesn’t enforce a specific CI/CD toolchain. OpenShift includes Jenkins and Pipelines (Tekton), but is more opinionated.

Less Overhead / Lower System Requirements:
Rancher and its managed clusters (especially K3s) have lower resource requirements compared to the relatively heavy OpenShift platform.
